#frc1885-2013

This project contains [FRC team 1885](http://iliterobotics.org)'s code for the 2013 competition [Ultimate Ascent](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa5MGEZNrf0).

Check out our [wiki](https://github.com/iliterobotics/frc1885-2013/wiki) and source code under several branches:

- [communications](https://github.com/iliterobotics/frc1885-2013/tree/communications) - Contains communication and data serialization code used throughout our system.
- [display](https://github.com/iliterobotics/frc1885-2013/tree/display) - Contains the display code for the drivers' station.
- [robot](https://github.com/iliterobotics/frc1885-2013/tree/robot) - Contains code for our robot. This runs on an NI CompactRIO.
- [vision](https://github.com/iliterobotics/frc1885-2013/tree/vision) - Contains video processing code used to track the saucer targets. We use a Kinect, which allows us to determine the distance from the robot to the target. At the moment, we are running the code on a PandaBoard.
